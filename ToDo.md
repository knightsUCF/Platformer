* lock to horiztonal mode

* introduce helper stuff with a black panel, and text, later figure out how to go without text

* hide controls in menu scene, instead of "press enter to continue", have a menu of contents:

* menu

  * game title
  * new game
  * load game
  * close
  
* decrease the size of the a, b, x, y button labels

* shake trees to get apples
 
  * shake trees like screen shake, or perhaps shake the whole game when we shake a tree, is there haptic feedback too on apple? android?
  
  * apples fall down with physics, adjust mass for effect, and put semi round collider on for them to roll
  
  * perhaps apples have some certain special abilities
  
  
* collecting apples goes well with the first leve, lots of gree, and pleasant easy terrain

* put up score for gold coins in the upper right hand corner

 * use the token class from the city builder project
 

* create a basic level with enough green forest, and apple shaking, and then also other color platforms with gold coins


* add gold coin pickup script

* perhaps add mist fog to certain levels if we can


* add the kind of style you would have in a classy vanilla, everything well chosen, extra ordinary classic, yet nothing out of place type aesthetic

* add power up abilities, like higher jumping allowing, or multiple jumping

* what other things to do to finish one level?

* choosing classy things are hard

* include farming, since already have the script, just get the x and y position, let the player just plant the seeds

* perhaps when they consume apples for health, they can then plant an apple tree

* this also gives the world permance

* as we shake the trees, we can get the fruit to plant those trees, perhaps we also have oranges

* the trees grow relativly quick, and can then be used as ways of getting more health points if we are fighting a boss, or a tough patch of the game

* simply show an "A" hovering above the tree, like the a bouncing in the cat game, copy and export that as a package, since that animation easing functionality is already set up, just show that when the player starts the game, so they know what to press
