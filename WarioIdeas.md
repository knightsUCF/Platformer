Warrio Land Can we call the game something like X - Land?


Things I’m noticing about Warrio




- Idle animation
- Destructible intractable world (blocks)
- Nice story set up, collect the macguffins in each of the world, told by a mysterious force, could do something similar but from a Haruki Murakami sequel more classy approach
- The first levels are usually green and have trees, we slowly add elements
- We teach the player game mechanic / button function, by placing obstacles in their way (destructible blocks) so to move on through the level they have to learn this mechanic, and we can do so without a tutorial
- Really like the caterpillars for instance, the enemies don’t die, warrior also doesn’t die, that’s very cool, when the caterpillars are jumped on they turn a ball, and then have a cool down period, before they can attack you again, and physics are applied to the spheres, so we could do that with the physics system, when jump near the back, there is a collider there, which suns the enemy, could set up a collider just on the back
- - I like how the enemies keep regenerating
- We could regenerate enemies based on spawn point colliders, so if the player move closer to the ladder, or to a a passing area, we spawn a creature right there
- We could also place colliders on different stuff, like creatures head rolling off
- Plus if the player keeps getting stuck behind a certain boss, we can just let the creature not re spawn the 10th time or so, and just let the player pass to keep the game going
- I like how they tempt you with the spinning key, we have a script for that, is that copyrighted?, the key is almost within your reach but the puzzle aspects make the solution not immediately apparent
- The rectangular cubes that we destroy, all the same size, with cracks, or some mark to distinguish them from other blocks in the environment, are essentially loot boxes, an elemental mechanic in this game, most of the time we get nothing, (nice ratio) but then sometimes there is something there to get
- Another great thing is how you can go back to a previous level with a new ability and unlock completely new features! This is a big one that people like
- I like also the thickness of the floor tiles, and the wall tiles
- Different types of ladders, each type of ladder design is particular to a level
- In betweenez screens to change up the thing
- Collecting treasures is a good goal also, other than the main goal of getting those macguffin artifacts back
- Each level should have own style
- The design doesn’t have to be perfect, but care should be shown of revealing something new in every scene, with a tasteful blocky contained design like Brass Langshire, and the thick but small in block units tiles, including floor, and walls
- In addition to getting coins, also there is a big coin to get for more tokens
- Some creatures can sleep with Zs, or perhaps no Zs and just sleeping and exhaling
- Random bosses
- Shatter small cubes everywhere on collision attack with destroyable cubes (destroyable environment is always a plus), so combine this with with physics just like with the enemies in Moenen demo stage
- For each level just need a different color scheme of bricks
- Procedurally generate the destroyable bricks each time, which are also loot boxes / skinner boxes
- Create a single prefab for the cube
- Look through all sorts of platfomers for tasteful ideas of tiles, get the design there, and then use adobe color schemes to customize for each level
- Procedurally generate two different levels, that are connected by a portal or loading screen, or both
- Have interesting names for each of the levels and also a level ID, like in Doom and Warrior L!, or simply just have L1
- L1 - Castle of Dreams, this is also a proper intro to the game
- Game sequence flow:  title screen with New Game as option, some nature background (will be in 3D), then the first level, not sure what comes exactly next, but we enter the story mode to explain to us a quest by a strange creature (Murakami), the quest of course is to collect these maguffins, so far so good use that, then when we accept the quest by simply pressing enter, or any action button, we start the game, so then do the title: L1  Castle of Dreams on a black panel background while muting with dark the rest of the screen by bringing down the transpareny, can mute whole background with one large panel, and then can have a second panel which is the background of the message box, black to stand out from the previous panel, black is probably a good choice if we are going to have lots of different color schemes, unless later we want to match the color scheme of each level, probably not
- Count on average how many different creatures per level, a level can also have a transition into another color scheme, and then feature old enemies for reuse, 
- Perhaps with physics we can project the loot coins in different directions based on random, so the player would try to position themselves on how to get the coins, or perhaps depending on the direction of the force vector of the cube the coins will project out at an angle to that, to simulate physics, yes find the best angle here
- Wario Land 2 playthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_p7h5t6V5Y
- Wario Land 3 playthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqJ_vWyzaUc
- Land is a really good name but might be copyrighted
- The zig zagging, staggered simple staircase just out of a few flat rectangular blocks at 3:04 of wario is amazing simple to do and looks good, also can go more in one direction in a different arrangement, as in 3:25, and again different in 4:07
- Torches will be cool to use a lot in dungeons, so one area would have the same torch, repeating lots, and then another area, and perhaps a new color scheme would have another torch, how many of these areas per level? Maybe 3
- The loot boxes can be very simple from the boxes, since we are not monetizing those, so we could have mostly coins, maybe a big coin once in a while, and then different types of gems, that is enough for MVP 
- An easy creature design is to just to give the creature two single voxel cubes for eyes, could be glowing white (nice emission effect, look up the Journey glowing robe tutorial, they mention the two things needed), and then the rest could be black, that’s for one creature, could use the same design for another creature but in a different color scheme
- Show the coins increasing the count up feature, research on google how to do that, where the coins at the end of the level go up to the amount, or perhaps we just do this on the screen, to not do any copyright stuff from warrior
- In wario, all we have for the UI are coins, so do that for the coins, and also one for the gems, well let’s just have gold coins
- Basically a coin collecting game lol
- In war we have the coin count int he lower right hand screen, a gold coin, and then a number
- Will that get in the way of controls? If we place in the top right?
- Perhaps have no counter, and just an inventory box on the bottom, where the start button is, in the center
- Or to simply the game don’t even use inventory, maybe just a stick later
- Snapping fish coming out of water is a good one for a level
- "High replay value and solid adventure platformer"
