most addictive games that people mentioned were full simulation (and social life) like World of Warcraft


building games - Age of Empires 2


People love to build


People also love to interact with the environment

Runescape - leveing up, "RPGing"

People love tetris and puzzles, so figure out someway of having to build the blocks as puzzles to pass a level



What if we include the building mechanic? the blocks that we destroy we can add to our inventory


at this point we will have 3 fun mechanics:

- destroy blocks
- build blocks
- evade and jump on top of enemies
- adventure setting (including ruins)
- tetris style building
