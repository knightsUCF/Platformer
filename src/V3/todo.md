- go through wario list, and pick out the most fun and quickest parts to implement

- simply block out all the levels with different color cubes as stand in for tiles

- before even going into the possible time sink of tile design, have the levels ready to go as blocks first


The most fun features are:

- jumping on creatures (plus creatures patrolling)

- destroying blocks


Can do so much just with those 



Features:

- destructible blocks, block puzzles (have to destroy blocks to pass)

- animated enemy going back and forth (can be just a block for now), if we touch the enemy we lose

- if we jump on enemy they die, plus then they respawn
